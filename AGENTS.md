# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

Kingdom of Agents is a windowed, decorated, resizable Tauri 2 desktop app that visualizes live activity from the [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli). It runs as an opaque normal-level window (not an overlay) so devs can park it on a second monitor while interacting with Copilot CLI in their primary terminal.

The architecture is **provider-agnostic by design** — the `AgentProvider` trait in `src-tauri/src/agent.rs` is the privacy boundary, and `CopilotProvider` is the only implementation that ships today. Adding Claude Code, Codex, or other CLIs is a matter of dropping in another provider (see "Adding a Provider" below).

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop shell:** Tauri 2 — decorated, resizable, opaque window. Tray icon with Show/Hide and Quit. Window size and position persisted via `tauri-plugin-window-state`.
- **Frontend:** Phaser 4 (Graphics + Image sprites), TypeScript (ES2022, strict, `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`, `.js` import extensions).
- **Backend:** Rust 2021. Owns `~/.copilot/session-state/` scanning, normalization, allowlisting, and the `notify = 8` filesystem watcher that pushes updates to the renderer via `window.__koaOnAgentActivityChanged()` calls.
- **Tests:** Playwright headless Chromium. The renderer is fully testable without Tauri because `window.__kingdomFixture` lets a test inject deterministic activity data.

## Build & Run

```bash
npm install                # install deps + regenerate package-lock
npm run build:frontend     # tsc + copy HTML/Phaser/assets to dist/
npm run build              # frontend + cargo build
npm start                  # frontend + cargo tauri dev (launches the window)
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                       # full suite (build + Playwright)
npx playwright test tests/code-kingdom.spec.ts # scene tests only
npx playwright test --headed                   # visible browser
```

The Playwright `webServer` config serves `dist/` over `python3 -m http.server 4173`. The current suite is **26 tests** covering startup, dashboard panels, replay/scrubber, session selection, ops mode classification, and a six-viewport layout regression.

## Key Patterns

- **`CodeKingdomScene` extends `Phaser.Scene` directly.** There is no `BaseScene`. The scene paints its own full-window backdrop in `create()` (depth -100) and redraws it on `scale.resize`.
- **Single scene.** Boot Phaser → instantiate `CodeKingdomScene` → resize listener calls `refreshDimensions()` + `scale.resize(W, H)` so the scene re-lays-out the dashboard on every window change.
- **Push-driven updates.** The Rust watcher debounces FS events (~300 ms) and calls `win.eval("window.__koaOnAgentActivityChanged && window.__koaOnAgentActivityChanged()")`. The 30 s poll in the scene is a fallback for environments where the watcher fails to attach.
- **Privacy invariant.** The `AgentProvider::scan()` boundary is the only place where Copilot session data is read. Only allowlisted fields cross into `AgentEventSummary` / `AgentSessionSummary` — never raw prompts, tool args, command output, file paths, or diffs.
- **`window.__codeKingdom`** exposes `getStatus()` / `saveSnapshot()` / `restartReplay()` / `clearCurrent()` / `clearAll()` / `disconnect()` for the top bar and for tests.
- **`window.__phaserGame`** is set so Playwright can reach into the scene registry without DOM scraping.
- **LocalStorage keys** are prefixed `koa_` (e.g., `koa_muted`, `koa_panels_hidden`, `koa_prefs`).

## Adding a Provider

The whole point of the `AgentProvider` trait is making this cheap. To add Claude Code, Codex, or a custom CLI:

1. Implement a `ClaudeCodeProvider` struct in `src-tauri/src/agent.rs` (or its own module) with `id()`, `label()`, `is_available()`, `state_root()`, and `scan() -> ProviderScan`.
2. In `scan()`, walk the provider's local state directory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<sid>.jsonl`, `~/.codex/sessions/<id>/`, etc.) and build `AgentSessionSummary` / `AgentToolMetric` / `AgentEventSummary` records. **Allowlist fields** — no raw prompts/args/output/paths/diffs.
3. Set `provider: "claude"` (or similar) on each summary so the renderer can color/icon-differentiate later.
4. Add the provider to `default_providers()`.

The watcher automatically attaches to each provider's `state_root()`, the merger handles top-N truncation globally across providers, and the renderer is provider-agnostic.

## Regenerating the README screenshots

`docs/img/dashboard.png` and `docs/img/focus-mode.png` are referenced from the README and the GitHub Pages landing page. Regenerate them after any noticeable UI change:

```bash
npm run build:frontend
(cd dist && python3 -m http.server 4173) &
node scripts/snap-readme.mjs   # writes both PNGs at 1440x900 @ 2x
kill %1
```

The script uses a deterministic rich fixture so the dashboard looks active. If you change the fixture, mirror the changes back into the README's "What it does" copy so the screenshot still matches the description.

## Releasing

```bash
npm run release <version>    # e.g. npm run release 0.2.0
```

`scripts/release.js`:

1. Bumps version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
2. Regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` from git via `git-cliff` (config: `cliff.toml`).
3. Commits everything, creates a `v<version>` tag, and pushes to `origin`.
4. The `Build & Release` workflow takes over: builds macOS (universal), Windows, and Linux installers, then attaches them to the GitHub Release.

All three version files must be updated together for installer filenames to be correct — the script does this automatically.
